\title{Simulate Piecewise-Constant Mean Structure with Random Shifts}
\usage{
mean_sim(n = 1000, n.seg = 10, min.seg.len = 20, mean.range = c(-10, 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Total length of the simulated sequence.}

\item{n.seg}{Integer. Number of contiguous segments.}

\item{min.seg.len}{Integer. Minimum length of each segment.}

\item{mean.range}{Numeric length-2 vector \code{(low, high)} giving the range
from which segment means are drawn (uniformly).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{n} containing the piecewise-constant
mean structure; \code{NULL} if inputs are infeasible.
}
\description{
Generates a length-\code{n} vector of segment means for a time series with
\code{n.seg} contiguous segments, each of length at least \code{min.seg.len}.
Segment means are drawn i.i.d. from a continuous uniform distribution over
\code{mean.range}. The result can be added to noise to create data with
frequent mean shifts.
